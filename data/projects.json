    "description": "TEACH is a platform that lets educators build intelligent tutors without programming or AI expertise. It uses generative AI to help design tutor interfaces and a hybrid generative and cognitive architecture to create expert models through demonstration and feedback. The system also serves as a research instrument to study tutor authoring, human–AI collaboration, and effective scaffolding.",

    "description": "Introduces LEARN (Learning by Example Agent & Reasoning Network), a hybrid system combining cognitive models and generative to learn procedural task hierarchies. A language model provides training data for a hierarchical task network (HTN) learning algorithm and an HTN interpreter is used to perform planning over the hierarchy to solve tasks.",
