    "description": "TEACH is a platform that lets educators build intelligent tutors without programming or AI expertise. It uses generative AI to help design tutor interfaces and the LEARN architecture to create expert models through demonstration and feedback. The system also serves as a research instrument to study tutor authoring, human–AI collaboration, and effective scaffolding.",

    "description": "Introduces LEARN (Learning by Example Agent & Reasoning Network), a hybrid system combining hierarchical task networks (HTNs) with language models (LMs) to learn procedural task hierarchies. The LM compliments the role of a human teacher by generating examples and new HTN elements while HTN interpreters provide structure and reliability. Tested in tutoring contexts, it learns faster with fewer examples than HTN-only systems.",
